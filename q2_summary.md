# Abstract

The paper describes a general class of models for ordinal data, utilising stochastic ordering to eliinate the need for assigning scores or assuming cardinality. Two models in particular, the **proportional odds** and the **proportional hazards** models, are of practical utility due to their conceptual simplicity.

# Introduction

Wall of text, will parse and write later.

# The Proportional Odds model

$$ κ_j(x) ∝ exp(-β^T **x**) $$
